> I have read articles describing the “death of data science.” Some people believed that data science was just a passing trend, and that the hype would die down soon before another field came to take its place.

Now, after more than a year of working in the data industry, I would like to share my insight on this topic — especially for beginners in the field who are often given contradictory advice and are hesitant about pursuing a data science career.

### Data Engineering vs. Data Science

I have read many different viewpoints online about data engineering replacing data science as the hottest job of the 21st century.

After working closely with both data engineering and data science teams, I have come to the conclusion that both fields are equally valuable.

Companies need data engineers. They need people who are able to take large amounts of data and make it usable.

The data analysts and data scientists then need to use this data to come up with business value. They create an end product that is profitable to the organization.

The reason data engineering is so hyped up now is because companies don’t have enough of them.

In the past, these organizations placed too much value on data scientists. They hired data scientists to build profitable models when they didn’t have a proper data pipeline in place.

Data scientists specialize in model building, and are unable to do much with massive amounts of real-time, unstructured data flowing in. This meant that they were unable to add much value to the organization — since the data wasn’t prepared in a way that they required it to be.

Now that companies are starting to realize this, they are putting more emphasis on hiring data engineers.

**This doesn’t mean that data scientists are redundant. Their model building skills are still profitable to organizations — this just comes later, once the data is ready to use**.

### Is there still a demand for data scientists?

> In 2020, every person generated 1.7 megabytes of data in just a second. 
Internet users generate about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day.

Data is being used to create massive change in many industries — healthcare, finance, marketing, business, etc.

I'd been worked in the different fields, and deal with millions of data points that are generated on a daily basis. These data points are used to observe the `pattern` and come up with different targeting strategies.

Companies need to hire individuals who can derive value from these data points.

A business analyst alone wouldn’t be able to do this, since they don’t possess technical knowledge.

As long as you can deal with massive amounts of data and solve problems with the help of this data, there is space for you in the industry.

However, you need to go beyond model building. You need to have domain expertise. You need to know how to source for external data with your technical skill. You need to have strong communication and problem-solving skills.

These are skills that will set you apart from the average data science aspirant.

Data science in practice is very different from data science in theory.

When working in the industry, it doesn’t matter if you work an entire day to make your model 1% more accurate than before. These things might be important in a **Kaggle** competition, but they don’t matter to stakeholders.

Things like the relevance of each feature to your model, model explainability, and applicability of your model to real-world scenarios are a lot more important.

A data scientist who possesses these skills is irreplaceable.

### Conclusion

Data science isn’t dying. The field is experiencing a shift, however, and companies are starting to look for people who can solve problems with data.

This doesn’t just include model building. When faced with a business problem, the answer doesn’t always lie in creating a machine learning model.

Sometimes, a simple SQL query or visualization might tell you everything you need to know. Employing ML techniques to address every data problem is expensive and time consuming, which is why you need to possess knowledge beyond that.

There is no automated tool that can replace the skillset of a data scientist, as long as you continuously learn and create data-driven solutions.

Last but not least, to apply AI technology to your business in most of the cases, you need create a solid big data platform in the first place, you can't make bricks without straw after all.
